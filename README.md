## Toxic Language Detection System

 ## Business Understanding
 ### Overview :
 The Toxigen dataset provides a collection of sentiments made online and targeted towards a
 minority group.The sentiments are general remarks towards this group prompted to users and
 allows generating own comments.The objective of this business case is to analyze the dataset
 and develop strategies that can help detect toxic or negative comments from sentiments made
 and develop a more refined and effective classifier to improve the accuracy of toxic language
 detection systems.
### Problem Statement :
 Online toxicity refers to negative, harmful, or abusive behavior exhibited in digital interactions.
 These digital channels include social media channels , websites, e-commerce sites, emails
 etc. Major examples of online toxicity are; cyberbullying, hate speech, harassment, and
 trolling.
 With the current rise in tech, online toxicity has created significant real-world consequences.
 This includes psychological harm to individuals and groups, mental health issues, low self
 esteem and societal division. Negative online interactions can damage the public image of
 minority groups leading to decreased support or engagement from the community or the world
 as a whole.
 Ensuring that detection systems can accurately identify toxic language without bias against
 these minority groups is essential for fostering a healthier online environment

 ### Mitigation Strategies and Solutions :
 Anonymity can allow users to express harmful opinions boldly that they might not otherwise
 express in face-to-face interactions. Without accountability, harmful behaviors like trolling,
 cyberbullying, and hate speech are more prevalent. Understanding the causes of online
 toxicity is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate it. Below are statistics and data
 on the various causes of toxicity in online platforms, supported by research and surveys.
 1. Anonimous accounts Encourages Toxic Behavior:
 Pew Research Center (2017): 41% of online users believe that the anonymity of the
 internet leads to more negative behavior. This means that when people create pseudo
 accounts, they are more prone to toxic comments because no one can identify them.
 2. Lack of Consequences:
 Online Behaviour Study (2020): 63% of individuals who engage in online harassment feel
 that their actions will have no real-world consequences

### To mitigate consequences of online toxicity, several strategies can be employed:
 1. Coming up with community guidelines and enforcing them to prevent and address toxic
 behavior.An example is Instagram which uses AI to detect comments that may seem
 harmful and separate them
 2. Offering access to counseling services and creating safe spaces for individuals affected
 by online harassment.There is rise in cases of mental health issues brough bout by
 bullying where we see people take their own lives or spiral into depression.If there is a
 mechanism of helping users with access to couselling services, this will improve their well
 being.
 3. Implementing stricter legal frameworks for dealing with cyberbullying and hate
 speech Developing consequences to cyberbullying will reduce the occurence
 Stakeholders :
### The major stakeholders in this uproject are;
 1. Social media companies.
 These include instagram,facebook,twitter,tiktok.They will use or models and findings and
 use them to reduce cyberbullying on their platforms.
 2. Online community managers.
 They will use insights to develop targeted strategies for managing toxic language online to
 their users.
 3. Decision makes/Law makers.
 Make strategic decisions based on analysis and allocate resources for interventions and
 rule book incase of violation of policies.
 4. Minority groups.
 Help them understand how online toxicity works and measures in place to detect and
 mitigate

### Next Steps:
 1. Data Analysis: Perform hypothesis testing and analyze the results to understand general
 sentiments and groups involved
 2. Strategy Development: Develop strategies based on insights to improve our model and
 features.
 3. Implementation: Apply strategies and monitor their effectiveness.
 Evaluation: Assess the impact of the strategies and adjust as necessary.
